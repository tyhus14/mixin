# H1 Mixins in SASS

With this project I created three separate mixins. I realize that the mixins that I created could be constructed by using a div class. I created these mixins to fully understand how mixins work.

### Mixin 1

This mixin is used for adjusting the height and width of a button and keeping the text aligned in the center. 

### Mixin 2

This mixin is used for creating a simple look of an avatar. 

### Mixin 3

This mixin could be used for creating multiple boxes with the same style.
